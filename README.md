# coding-quiz
This is a multiple choice quiz that has a time of 60 seconds to complete the quiz but with a twist! If you answer a question wrong you loos 5 seconds off your timer. The objective is to complete the quiz with the most time left and at the end of the quiz you can put your initials in and automatically save your time left so that it can be kept in the highscores section where you can compete against friends or yourself.
